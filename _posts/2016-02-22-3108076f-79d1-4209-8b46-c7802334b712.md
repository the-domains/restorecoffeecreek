Back in 2005 we bought into a beautiful piece of California, 2.5 miles of Coffee Creek located in the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area. Parts of our spread were mined in the 1870s---1900s and again in the 1930s---60s. Hydraulic mining ruined the entire length of Coffee Creek's 27 miles but the tailing piles created by Chinese laborers in the 1870s have become overgrown with forest. The last mile or so of the property was mined in the 30s and is still bare rock tailing piles. It is this part of the creek that I would like to restore.  
My plan is simple. Plant native/local deciduous trees like Cottonwoods, Willow and Maples at the edges of the tailing piles. Let their leaves begin to create new dirt and the trees themselves provide shelter for the evergreens.
